# getFit

getFit is designed to guide users toward their health goals with clear, goal-based programs.

Main Purpose and Target Audience: Modern lifestyles often limit time for exercise, getFit tackles this
issue by providing straightforward workout plans, simple tracking features, and guidance for users of
all experience levels who need to achieve goals ranging from strength and endurance to weight
management.

Key Features: getFit delivers goal-oriented programs that allow users to track sets, reps, rest times,
and bodyweight. A diet log is available to record meals and offer healthy eating tips. A streak system
rewards daily consistency, while a badge system celebrates major achievements (e.g., maintaining a
routine for a year).

Platform and Data Storage: Built with Flutter, getFit runs on Android from a single codebase.
It stores height, weight, sex, workout logs, and diet entries.
